# GenHook Production Configuration Example
# Copy this file to app-config.prod.ini and customize for production deployment
# This file demonstrates how to configure GenHook to run directly on port 443

[server]
# Set to 0.0.0.0 to accept connections from any IP
host = 0.0.0.0
# Set to 443 for direct HTTPS, or keep 8000 for reverse proxy setup
port = 443
# Set to false in production for better performance
reload = false

[sl1]
# Your production SL1 server API endpoint
api_url = https://your-sl1-server.com/api/alert
# Your SL1 credentials (consider using environment variables for security)
username = your_sl1_username
password = your_sl1_password
# Timeout for SL1 API calls (seconds)
timeout = 30
# Number of retry attempts for failed SL1 API calls
retry_attempts = 3

[logging]
# Production logging level (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
level = INFO
# Log format string
format = %(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s
# Log file location (ensure GenHook has write permissions)
file = /var/log/genhook.log

[threading]
# Increase for high-volume production environments
max_workers = 100
# Larger queue for handling traffic spikes
queue_size = 20000
# Timeout for processing individual webhooks (seconds)
processing_timeout = 30

[webhook_logging]
# Enable webhook payload logging for debugging and testing
enabled = true
# Directory to store webhook logs (ensure GenHook has write permissions)
base_directory = logs/webhooks
# Maximum log file size in bytes (10MB)
max_bytes = 10485760
# Number of backup files to keep
backup_count = 5
# Log file name
log_file_name = payload.log

[sl1_graphql]
# Enable SL1 Event Policy creation via GraphQL
enabled = true
# Your production SL1 GraphQL endpoint
endpoint = https://your-sl1-server.com/graphql
# Your SL1 credentials (same as [sl1] section)
username = your_sl1_username
password = your_sl1_password
# Timeout for GraphQL requests (seconds)
timeout = 30

# Notes:
# - To use this config: cp app-config.prod.ini.example app-config.prod.ini
# - GenHook automatically uses .prod.ini if it exists
# - For port 443: ensure SSL certificates are properly configured
# - For reverse proxy: keep port as 8000 and configure nginx/Apache
# - Update SL1 credentials with your actual production values
